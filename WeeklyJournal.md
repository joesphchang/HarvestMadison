# Weekly Jounral 

Document project progress, the development process, accomplishments, snags,
and time spent in Enterprise Java.

### February 12th, 2026 "The Catch Up"

Today I plan on playing catch-up for this project plan. It's a lot more than I thought but it's doable since I've done
project plans before ranging from Screen Designs, to User Stories. Today I plan on tackling User Stories, Screen Design, 
and the Project Plan. My plan is to do the Project Plan and the User Stories first, before I head into Screen Design.
Therefor, it'll be easier for me to create those Screen Design based off of my plans. These weeks have been eventful,
but I have to make sure I stay up ontop of this project as I could be doing a lot of it last minute. I think I'm going to try
and set up my database and users as well, creating first name, last name, email address, username and password. possibly add
in a birthdate. 

### February 16th, 2026 "Setting Up What Matters"

This week I plan on focusing on setting up the application from database reformat, inserting data into the database, 
to showing the data onto a webpage. Going to do a couple unit testing on get-put-update-delete a user within a database.
Also, I will do the same with an ingredient and recipe. Creating a new recipe owned by a user, updating it, deleting and
getting it to show up on from a search-case. Will do more research on Spoonacular and how to incorporate the API within
my application. This will allow me to set-up and move at ease. Once the logic is done, it's really just setting up the 
JSP pages and getting them to interact with one another. I should probably figure out how to use bootstrap within Java
so I can spend less time on styling and more time on logic-building. 

The plan for seasonal ingredients is to insert data into a Seasonal Ingredient table only within Wisconsin. Utilizing
Dates MM/DD and comparing it to real time to display the actual ingredient. Matching the ingredient within Spoonacular
to get recipes, ingredient photo, ingredient name, etc. 

### February 21st, 2026 "Test Complete"

I had the week planned out to finish out week 5 and get everything squared away. It was a long week trying to get my project
all set up. I feel like this is the long haul, and once this is all done everything from here on out will be a smooth sail.
I look forward to the upcoming weeks as I deploy this project onto AWS. I plan on doing some boilerplate HTML just to see
what I can get under the hood to display. 

Plan on integrating bootstrap and figuring out the styling throughout. Once I get the pages to all-align and my head/navigation
all squared away onto all my pages I feel like it's all styling from here on out until we get into RESTful Web Services
and then I got to figure out how to match seasonal ingredients to the ingredients within the Spoonacular API database, 
pull all the information out specifically for the monthly ingredients. For now, we digress and move forward as we did accomplish
what was needed to be done for this week and more.
