### February 12th, 2026 "The Catch Up"

Today I plan on playing catch-up for this project plan. It's a lot more than I thought but it's doable since I've done
project plans before ranging from Screen Designs, to User Stories. Today I plan on tackling User Stories, Screen Design, 
and the Project Plan. My plan is to do the Project Plan and the User Stories first, before I head into Screen Design.
Therefor, it'll be easier for me to create those Screen Design based off of my plans. These weeks have been eventful,
but I have to make sure I stay up ontop of this project as I could be doing a lot of it last minute. I think I'm going to try
and set up my database and users as well, creating first name, last name, email address, username and password. possibly add
in a birthdate.
