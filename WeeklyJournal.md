### February 12th, 2026 "The Catch Up"

Today I plan on playing catch-up for this project plan. It's a lot more than I thought but it's doable since I've done
project plans before ranging from Screen Designs, to User Stories. Today I plan on tackling User Stories, Screen Design, 
and the Project Plan. My plan is to do the Project Plan and the User Stories first, before I head into Screen Design.
Therefor, it'll be easier for me to create those Screen Design based off of my plans. These weeks have been eventful,
but I have to make sure I stay up ontop of this project as I could be doing a lot of it last minute. I think I'm going to try
and set up my database and users as well, creating first name, last name, email address, username and password. possibly add
in a birthdate. 

### February 16th, 2026 "Setting Up What Matters"

This week I plan on focusing on setting up the application from database reformat, inserting data into the database, 
to showing the data onto a webpage. Going to do a couple unit testing on get-put-update-delete a user within a database.
Also, I will do the same with an ingredient and recipe. Creating a new recipe owned by a user, updating it, deleting and
getting it to show up on from a search-case. Will do more research on Spoonacular and how to incorporate the API within
my application. This will allow me to set-up and move at ease. Once the logic is done, it's really just setting up the 
JSP pages and getting them to interact with one another. I should probably figure out how to use bootstrap within Java
so I can spend less time on styling and more time on logic-building. 

The plan for seasonal ingredients is to insert data into a Seasonal Ingredient table only within Wisconsin. Utilizing
Dates MM/DD and comparing it to real time to display the actual ingredient. Matching the ingredient within Spoonacular
to get recipes, ingredient photo, ingredient name, etc.
